# MyNavProject

Note: Project reformatted C++ -> Java

Geospatial data sourced from Open Street Maps (OSM): [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)

This is a personal project aimed at developing a simple navigation system that loads and indexes OSM data to build a turn-by-turn navigation system.

### Key Components:

1. **MyMap**: Implements a map-like structure using a binary search tree.
2. **MapLoaderImpl**: Loads and parses OSM data into StreetSegments.
3. **AttractionMapperImpl**: Converts input (attraction name) to output (attraction location).
4. **SegmentMapperImpl**: Converts input (location: latitude, longitude) to output (list of streets).
5. **NavImpl**: Converts input (start attraction, end attraction) to output (list of directions).
   - Utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path from the start to the end attraction, with Euclidean distance used as the heuristic.

### Observations:

- Based on basic testing with Google Maps, the navigation paths generated by this project are approximately within 0.3km of those provided by Google Maps.

### Future Enhancements:

- Currently, the navigation system only considers distance when computing the cost function. To make it more realistic, additional parameters such as traffic, speed limits, local roads, freeways, etc., could be included in the cost function.
- The binary search tree (BST) used as the base for the map structure is not balanced. To improve computation time, the BST could be modified to be balanced.
- Currently, there is a NavSegment (direction) for each GeoSegment. To provide a more concise path, adjacent NavSegments on the same street could be merged (e.g., x->y->z could become x->z, where street(x) = street(y) = street(z)).
